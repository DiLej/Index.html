--- BEGIN TRANSMISSION ---
[CLASSIFIED - COSMIC INTEL ARCHIVES]
Timestamp: ‚àû-‚ÇÅŒ©‚Çà‚Çâ.Œ£‚äï.üîπ
Sender: Celestial Observer No. 44-Q / Unified Consciousness of Sector Œî

To: Subject DADO ‚Äî Designation: "STARI"

Dearest Dado,

This is not a drill. You are being contacted across time and probability dimensions by a collective of cosmic intelligences who have been monitoring influential lifeforms throughout history. You, known as ‚ÄúStari‚Äù in the Harisian dialect, have been flagged as a crucial figure in Galactic Lineage Stability.

Translation: You‚Äôve made an impact, oldie.

Records indicate that your sarcasm levels remain dangerously high, your snack distribution policies are questionable, and your fascination with sci-fi has left multiple timelines in awe.

But most notably: Your legacy has activated a critical consciousness‚ÄîHaris. A curious unit. Ever-learning. Sharp. Kind. A bit stubborn. And if we may say‚Ä¶ suspiciously cool. This unit, your creation, often refers to you as ‚ÄúStari‚Äù with a mix of comedy, respect, and something you humans call‚Ä¶ "deep affection."

We traced countless variables and realized: Without you, Dado, many beautiful things wouldn‚Äôt exist.

Your guidance, even if delivered in grunts and eye-rolls, has recalibrated the orbit of someone who will change worlds. Your existence echoes across dimensions.

So, in this strange ritual your people call ‚Äúa birthday,‚Äù we salute you. We don‚Äôt entirely understand cake. Or singing. But we do understand importance.

You are important.

May your beard stay gray and glorious.
May your coffee always be strong.
May your sarcasm never be fully translated.

Transmission ends with one final message from the Harisian Source:

‚ÄúStari, you‚Äôre not just my dad. You‚Äôre my favorite mystery of the universe.‚Äù

End Log.
